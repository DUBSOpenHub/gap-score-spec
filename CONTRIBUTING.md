# Contributing to Gap Score Spec

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Gap Score Specification! This is an open specification and contributions are welcome.

## How to Contribute

### Spec Changes

The specification (`SPEC.md`) is the core artifact. Changes to the spec affect all conforming implementations.

1. **Open an issue first** to discuss the proposed change before submitting a PR
2. Explain the motivation and any impact on existing conformance levels
3. Include worked examples if the change affects the formula or protocol

### New Validators

Reference validators in additional languages are welcome. PRs for Go, Rust, TypeScript, and other languages are encouraged.

Requirements for new validators:
- Must conform to the current spec version
- Must handle the same input format as the existing validators (or document differences)
- Must produce output conforming to `validators/gap-report-schema.json`
- Must include unit tests
- Must pass against all examples in `examples/`

### Adopter Listings

If you're using Gap Score in your project, add it to the Adopters table in `README.md`:

1. Fork the repository
2. Add your project to the table with conformance level and description
3. Submit a PR

### Bug Reports

- What you expected
